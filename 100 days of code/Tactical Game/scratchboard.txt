What are the different states?

1. AP > 0 the player can move around, actions cost AP. scoreboard is updated
2. AP == 0 the player can not move around and the scoreboard displays the question, "for next turn press 'enter' "
3. AP == 0 and the player pressed 'enter'. the AP-count is reset. and the player can move around again.

Flags:
game_is_on: True as long the game runs
next_turn:  For checking if the next turn should start. needs AP == 0 and Return key to be pressed to be True
waiting_for_next_turn: True as long the Enter key has not been pressed and AP == 0


WHILE game_is_on:
    IF waiting_for_next_turn IS False (PLAYING_STATE):
        - Process movement (cost AP)
        - If AP reaches 0, set waiting_for_next_turn = True

    IF waiting_for_next_turn IS True (WAITING_STATE):
        - Ignore all movement
        - Display "Press Enter"
        - If Enter pressed: set waiting_for_next_turn = False, reset AP to 50
